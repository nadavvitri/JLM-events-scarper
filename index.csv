King David: The New Light Show at the Tower of David,2018-9-13T20:00:00,"Tower of David, Jaffa Gate, Jerusalem","Throughout history, King David has always been a legendary character who has caught the attention of many painters, sculptors, and poets. Now he is making a comeback to his own city with a new night spectacular for the whole family at Tower of David Museum. The show is projected on the walls of the citadel after sunset and promises a once-in-a-lifetime experience. With this stunning show, Tower of David Museum offers a new, modern, and artistic perspective on the biblical story of the most famous king in history.
Using cutting-edge technology, the show creates an unprecedented international and artistic attraction suitable for all ages. The show features powerful laser projectors, a computerized system operating 20 projectors, 10 audio players, 14 computers, 14 speakers and amplifiers, and 10 kilometers of advanced cable infrastructure.
The new night experience is a multi-sensory celebration that ties the past, the present, and the future, using state-of-the-art technology. The show tells the life story of King David, starting at his youth days as a young, handsome, and red-haired shepherd in the fields of Bethlehem who was anointed king over Israel by Samuel.
The experience begins with a virtual tour of famous works by the greatest artists of all times: Chagall, Matisse, Michelangelo, and more. The citadel walls display beautiful images of waterfalls and foliage, inspired by the Ein Gedi oasis that’s tied to David’s biblical story. As the night goes on, you are exposed to more and more imagery and events related to the exciting and thrilling life story of King David – all based on biblical, historical, and archaeological sources.
You will also experience a spectacular light & sound show with the educational part of the experience, psalm songs attributed to David, and a modern musical celebration of songs of praise and happiness dedicated to Jerusalem and its beloved king.
“The show features unique techniques that combine original video footage with hand drawn illustrations, graphic designs, and music – all created exclusively for the show. The show features different kinds of animation, advanced techniques, and revolutionary editing methods. All of the above create the ultimate three-dimensional experience that makes you feel that the characters on the walls are in fact living people, and the spectator stops being an observer and becomes an experiencer and an active participant in the occurring events.”
